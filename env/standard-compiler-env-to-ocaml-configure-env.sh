      # Clang Integrated Assembler
      # --------------------------
      #
      # Clang has an integrated assembler that will can be invoked indirectly (`clang --target xxx -c something.s`)
      # or directly (`clang -cc1as -help`). Calling with the `cc1as` form directly is rarely a good idea because the
      # `--target` form can inject a lot of useful default options when it itself calls `clang -cc1as <options-for-target>`.
      #
      # The integrated assembler is not strictly compatible with GNU `as` even though it recognizes GNU assembly syntax.
      # For OCaml the problem is that the integrated assembler will "error: invalid symbol redefinition" on OCaml native
      # generated assembly code like:
      #   .L108:
      #   .L108:
      # 	  bl	camlCamlinternalFormatBasics__entry(PLT)
      # Until those bugs are fixed we can't use clang for native generated code (the `AS` ./configure variable). However
      # clang can be used for the assembly code in the runtime library (the `ASPP` ./configure variable) since that assembly
      # code is hand-crafted and also because the clang integrated assembler has a preprocessor.

      # Android NDK
      # -----------
      #
      # Android NDK comes with a) a Clang compiler and b) a GNU AS assembler and c) sometimes a YASM assembler
      # in its bin folder
      # (ex. ndk/23.1.7779620/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin/{clang,arm-linux-androideabi-as,yasm}).
      # The Android NDK toolchain used within CMake will select the Clang compiler as its CMAKE_ASM_COMPILER.
      #
      # The GNU AS assembler (https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/as/index.html) does not support preprocessing
      # so it cannot be used as the `ASPP` ./configure variable.
      
      # XCode (macOS/iOS)

      # `AS=as -arch <target>` to select the architecture, and AS will have already been set with
      # autodetect_compiler_darwin().

      # Triples
      # -------

      # It also has the same triple in CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE.
      # Other toolchains may support it as well; CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE is poorly documented, but
      # https://lldb.llvm.org/resources/build.html indicates it is typically set to the architecture triple

      #
