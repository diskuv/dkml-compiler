# ARM32

Same as [ocaml-cross-4_14_0-a02-arm32.md](ocaml-cross-4_14_0-a02-arm32.md) which is an old PR except to resolve conflicts:

1. Prefer <https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/11184> over the old arm32 PR

NOTE: The extensive file number changes could be merged with `ocaml-common-4_14-a09-debuggasx86`
but that can be done if and when `ocaml-common-4_14-a09-debuggasx86` needs a change
from `ocaml-cross-4_14_2-a02-a32`.
